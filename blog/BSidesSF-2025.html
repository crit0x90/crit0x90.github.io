                        <h2>Why I Went</h2>
                        <p>
                            Around March of this year I decided that I needed to do a little in-person networking. I wanted to learn more about
                            the broader infosec and tech industry and, given my proximity to the Bay Area, I decided to find a meet up in San 
                            Francisco. I did a little research an stumbled across BSides.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I went to BSides with learning about the industry and meeting people that work in it as my main goal. I didn't have any
                            plans to participate in the CTF competitions and chose to attend panels when I needed a break from socializing instead.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                        <h4>General Career Advice</h4>
                        <p>
                            I wanted some diverse perspectives on my career prospects and how I could improve as a professional, so I sought career advice from as 
                            many people as I could. One common piece of advice from the weekend was that I needed more 
                            experience. In the past, I've always thought of experience as the thing that you get paid to do, but I was told that there were
                            other things you could do that people would count as experience. For example, Bug Bounty programs, open source development, personal
                            projects, and research can all contribute to your resume to fill experience gaps.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another piece of advice that I got repeatedly was to create a targeted T-shaped resume. Targeted in that you should build your resume
                            around the types of companies that you want to work for and T-shaped in that you should demonstrate broad experience in multiple areas and 
                            mastery in one area. For example, someone told me that I might try to show general knowledge of internal/external/application pentesting
                            but then master one or two more niche skills like securing Kubernetes or Mac environments.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Tech Stuff</h4>
                        <p>
                            In between all the career stuff, I did find some time to see a few technical talks and talk security with some people. I meantioned that I was
                            interested in learning k8s hacking to a guy and he told me to start with the "K8s the Hard Way" tutorials followed by the Kubenomicon. So far 
                            they've both been enlightening. I also saw a great talk by Breanne Boland about how pentesting AI agents isn't really that different from 
                            pentesting webapps.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>
                            BSidesSF was a great experience and I'll definitely go again next year!
